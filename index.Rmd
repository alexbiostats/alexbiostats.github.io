### *Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics*

<img src="./files/alex-kaizer.jpg" style="width:30%; border:6px solid; margin-right:20px; margin-bottom:20px" align="left">

I am a tenured Associate Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics & Informatics (B&I)](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/education/departments/biostatistics-informatics) and the [Center for Innovative Design and Analysis (CIDA)](https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/research-and-practice/centers-programs/cida) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://cuanschutz.edu/). 

My research interests are in the development of Bayesian statistical methods for information sharing and in the design of adaptive clinical trials. I am also interested in the intersection of these two areas to develop novel adaptive clinical trial designs that more efficiently and effectively utilize available resources, past trials, and past studies. I am currently an NHLBI K01 scholar working to extend these methods and designs to the world of cardiovascular outcomes research. Within CIDA I collaborate with clinicians and scientists across campus in translational research, especially in applications relating to gastroenterology, cardiology, anesthesiology, and pediatric obesity.

I earned my BS in Demographic Analysis (Interdisciplinary Studies) from [Truman State University](https://www.truman.edu/) in 2012 and my PhD in Biostatistics from the [University of Minnesota](https://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/biostatistics/) in 2017. My dissertation was advised by [Joe Koopmeiners](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/koopm007/) and focused on the development of multi-source exchangeability models (MEMs) as a general Bayesian approach to incorporating supplemental or historic data sources into a primary analysis.

Feel free to reach out with any questions relating to my research or teaching, the graduate program in Biostatistics at the University of Colorado, or anything else:
